# IBM-s-Customer-Analytics-and-Market-Trends

I'm excited to share my recent project "IBM's Customer Analytics and Market Trends", which focused on analyzing key data points and deriving actionable insights to improve business strategies. Through analysis and dashboard creation, I've uncovered several pivotal findings that can significantly impact business trajectory.

Firstly, here is the project link where you can interact with the dashboard.

The foundation of this project began with a comprehensive data extraction and cleaning process. Leveraging SQL queries, I extracted pertinent data from MySQL database, establishing a seamless connection to Power BI for in-depth analysis. This method ensured the accuracy and relevance of the information utilized throughout the project.

SQL queries not only helped extract and clean data but also assisted in uncovering insights, identifying and rectifying mistakes, missing information, and irregularities in the dataset. This involved thoroughly cleaning and improving the quality of the collected data, ensuring its trustworthiness and reliability for subsequent analysis.

Now, let's delve into the key discoveries and proposed strategies:

For offer 4, I see that it needs to be reorganized as it is the lowest offer used, with just 1024 customers, 360 complaints, and only "no" responses, so I am sure there is a problem with this offer.

The web channel is the least used, as there are only 1325 users with 494 complaints. and even the call center channel is better than it. This can cause a problem in the future because, as your customer base grows, the demand for call center employees will also increase. It's advisable to restructure your web channel.

Streamlining claim processes where the average claim amount is high to reduce costs and improve efficiency, especially for luxury SUVs, luxury cars, and sports cars. They also need an offer.

Focusing on regions with the highest customer density, like California, for localized marketing campaigns.

These findings illuminate critical areas where strategic investments and optimizations can unlock latent potential, steering the business towards enhanced performance. I am enthusiastic about translating these insights into actionable strategies to drive impactful changes.
